Energy Source Distribution for Cooking Appliances
Graph Type: Pie Chart or Bar Graph
Description: Visualize the proportion of U.S. households using different energy sources (natural gas, electricity, propane, etc.) for cooking.
Data Needed: Number of households using each type of cooking appliance (from EIA RECS or AHS).
Analysis: Calculate percentages of total households for each energy source.


Trends in Cooking Appliance Adoption Over Time
Graph Type: Line Graph
Description: Illustrate changes in the adoption rates of electric vs. gas cooking appliances over a period.
Data Needed: Historical data on appliance sales or household usage (from industry reports or EIA historical data).
Analysis: Identify trends and growth rates in appliance adoption.


Energy Consumption Comparison Between Appliance Types
Graph Type: Bar Graph
Description: Compare average annual energy consumption of different cooking appliances (e.g., gas stove vs. electric coil vs. induction).
Data Needed: Energy usage data per appliance type (from LBNL or manufacturer specifications).
Analysis: Calculate and compare energy consumption and efficiency levels.


Potential Emission Reductions from Electrification
Graph Type: Stacked Bar Graph or Area Chart
Description: Project greenhouse gas emission reductions achievable by switching from gas to electric cooking.
Data Needed: Emission factors for natural gas and electricity, number of households that could transition (from EPA and EIA data).
Analysis: Estimate total emissions for current vs. electrified scenarios.
